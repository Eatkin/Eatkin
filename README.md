## Who I Am

Hi, I'm Ed.  
Data Ops Engineer by trade. I also build full-stack apps, game engines, weird automation tools, and occasionally write blog posts about them.  
I like solving real problems with clean abstractions and building things that mostly run themselves.

## Projects and Writing

Most of my work lives here:
**→ [edwardatkin.co.uk](https://www.edwardatkin.co.uk)**

You'll find tools, code experiments, automation hacks, and the occasional opinion piece:

## Ask Me About

- Python (esp. automation and code architecture)
- Why GUI was a mistake
- Juggling, rolla bollas, and other circus-related nonsense
- The project where my Raspberry Pi places horse racing bets
- How I'm trying to automate myself out of a job

## Personal Stack

- **Philosophy:** I aim for code that's modular, reusable and often unreasonably abstracted.
- **Automation:** I use the Slack API to make sure 2am cron jobs ping me if something breaks.
- **Betting Bot:** Raspberry Pi + Betfair API + MLP architecture = passive income stream. Kind of.
- **Editor Wars:** Vim, but moving to Emacs Evil Mode.
- **Hardware:** Electric kettle. Critical dependency.

## Irrelevant But Real Skills

- Can exit Vim _and_ Emacs.
- Can juggle, unicycle, and rollerblade (not simultaneously, yet)
- Built a CV as a zine: [cvzine.edwardatkin.co.uk](https://zines.edwardatkin.co.uk/viewer/cvzine)
