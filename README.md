# ED.EXE // STATUS: ONLINE

Hi. I'm Ed.
A Data Ops Engineer. Also a Full-Stack Web Dev. And a Software Engineer. And a Game Dev.
Basically, if it involves programming things or building automation tools, I'm probably doing it.

### My Projects (Enter If You Dare)

Scattered across the internet, but I did aim to centralise everything for my website https://www.edwardatkin.co.uk

### Brain Dump (aka My Blog)

I regularly inflict my thoughts upon the internet...on my website. (If you want programming stuff go here https://edwardatkin.co.uk/?collection=coding_heaven)

### Inquiries (Proceed with Caution)

* **Ask me about:** Python, why GUI was a mistake, rolla bollas, general clownery, how automating myself out of a job is going,
* **How to reach me:** Carrier pigeon. Or make a pull request. Once I had my email here and I hear from more (probably non-existent) SEO experts than there are people on the planet.

### Vital Stats & Weird Flexes

* **My Philosophy:** I don't follow the rule of three; I follow the rule of zero. If I write something once, it's getting abstracted into a class. My code is 100% abstract, 100% modular, and 100% extensible. I *am* obsessed. It's actually kind of weird.
* **The Stack of Pain:** GUI was a mistake, Vim is a good code editor, and what's a Javascript library?
* **The Money Printer:** Back in the day, I dabbed in ML. Now I have a horse racing predictor based on an MLP architecture that prints money. My Raspberry Pi uses the Betfair API to place bets for me. It's fully self-aware. I literally do nothing.
* **Life Goal:** Automate myself out of a job. It's going pretty well. I use the Slack API so my 2am cron jobs can tell me if anything is on fire.
* **Fun Facts:** Juggling, rollerblading, unicycling, and banjo plucking. You could say I hyperfocus on random hobbies. These ones stuck. Probably because they're weird.

This readme is not just a readme. It's a statement. It's an experience. It's a journey.

**My CVZine:** https://zines.edwardatkin.co.uk/viewer/cvzine

No, I don't have a normal CV.
